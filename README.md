# TextSpinner (tspinner)

Needed a small utility to spin text to add to my hubot, so I build this. Quick and simple.


## NPM

To use, simply install with

    npm install tspinner

And then simply import with with `require` and:

    spinner('a {and|or} b') // the result will be `a and b` or `a or b`
